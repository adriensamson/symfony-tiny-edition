Symfony Tiny Edition
====================

This tiny Symfony Edition is based on the [Standard Edition](http://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard).
Only FrameworkBundle, TwigBundle and WebProfilerBundle (dev-only) have been kept.

This edition is intended for people who know exactly which packages they need
and don't want to remove all the packages they won't use in the standard edition.
